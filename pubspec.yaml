# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
flutter:
  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  #To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - .env
    - assets/images/logo.svg
    - assets/images/logo_umww.png
    - assets/images/wave-playstore.png
    - assets/images/patrol_notification_blue.svg
    - assets/images/patrol_notification_circle.svg
    - assets/images/patrol_notification_white.svg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware
  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Roboto
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto/Roboto-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto/Roboto-Italic.ttf
          style: italic
        - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto/Roboto-Italic.ttf
